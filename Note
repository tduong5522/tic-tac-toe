Concept

- "key" in tag <li> will have React know what list item should be re-render.

- Why Immutability Is Important?
Because with data mutate like array, object, function when we clone a mutate data which copy only reference of array without value of the array.
So we should use .slice() or spread to clone a mutate data. But I won't effect with object or array which have more levels.
Because it's shallow copy(copy only one level of array)

Error:

1. setState an object in React Hook but UIs aren't re-render.

2. clone an array but when changed attribute in array

Solve:
1 vs 2: clone another object and making on this.
